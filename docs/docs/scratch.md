## Hashable

When `CbtechLtd\Fastlane\Support\Eloquent\Concerns\Hashable` class is added to a model, its `hashid`
column will be automatically used as the route key on Control Panel URLs. The Hash ID is generated
based on model class and its id.

## You decide how to consume the content

You're not restricted to use only Laravel to build your website frontend. For instance, you
could consume your content through Fastlane API from your beloved static site generator while
your mobile dev team fetch the content from an Android or iPhone native application. Anyway, if
you want to use Laravel and its blade template system to build your site, Fastlane has your back.
