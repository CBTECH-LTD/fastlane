    Fastlane is a platform to develop content-driven websites faster than ever.
    It's built with Laravel, the most popular PHP framework, and you can use it
    in any Laravel-based project, new or already up and running. It does not impose
    any schema to your content or how will you consume the content. Do you want to
    use it in a static site generator? Check. Do you want to use Laravel blade templates? Check.
</p>

## You decide how your schema looks like

Fastlane does not impose any schema to your content. You won't need to wrap your mind
around dozens of meaningless - e.g.  _posts_ or _posts_meta_ - tables. You are in control
of how data will be saved to your database.

## You decide how to consume the content

You're not restricted to use only Laravel to build your website frontend. For instance, you
could consume your content through Fastlane API from your beloved static site generator while
your mobile dev team fetch the content from an Android or iPhone native application. Anyway, if
you want to use Laravel and its blade template system to build your site, Fastlane has your back.
